His journey started with <a href='https://carrd.co'>Carrd</a>, a one page website maker for pretty much anything. Nate enjoyed learning code such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to break the limiting barriers of carrd for extra features, functionalities and fun interactivity. When the record label's plan called for more features that Carrd couldn't handle, Nate moved the platform over to <a href='https://ycode.com'>Ycode</a>. Nate later became an official Ycode expert, and still enjoys creating fun and intricate websites and components in code to bring that extra finesse into his web projects."
